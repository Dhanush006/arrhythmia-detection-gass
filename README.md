## Description
This repository contains the code routines for *Detection of Arrhythmia from Electrocardiogram Signals using a novel Gaussian Assisted Signal Smoothing and Pattern Recognition* [1] in [MATLAB](https://in.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) and [Python 3](https://www.python.org).

>### Abstract of [1]
>In our work, we propose an algorithm for pre-processing raw Electrocardiogram signals via Gaussian Assisted Signal Smoothing. This technique preserves the structure and morphological details of the signal whilst eliminating noise, thereby enhancing its peak signal-to-noise ratio. Finally, the effectiveness of this algorithm is exemplified by training two Convolutional Neural Network models on raw Electrocardiogram data and proposed Gaussian Assisted Signal Smoothing for arrhythmia classification. The higher training
and test accuracies obtained for the model on GASS signals can signify this techniqueâ€™s effectiveness in Electrocardiogram signal processing.
